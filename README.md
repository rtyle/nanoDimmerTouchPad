This contains the design of a printed circuit board that can be powered by an Aeotec Nano Dimmer.
It provides a touch pad that acts as an external momentary switch to the Nano Dimmer for controlling its load.

The size of the circuit board is suited for replacing the smarts in a Legrand Adorne touch switch.

The CAMOutputs can be zipped up and sent to a board fabrication shop.
